# WithHelper

This example uses a custom element to provide a better UX when using a masked
float field.

## Running the example

You can check out [this example on Ellie](https://ellie-app.com/fjCTFLnfJ64a1),
or you can run it locally:

```bash
cd src
elm make Main.elm --output=src/main.js
npx http-server
```

That will start the server on [localhost:8080/index.html](localhost:8080/index.html),
and you can play with the example there.
